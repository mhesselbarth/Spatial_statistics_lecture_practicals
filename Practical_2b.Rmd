# Practical 2b

First, we load all needed packages, just as before.

```{r, message = FALSE}
  library(spatstat)
  library(tidyverse)
```

## Exercise 5 
__Task:__ Calculate the bivariate g12 function using the null model random labeling. Was the process that labeled trees as dead or alive a random process. 

In case it is not in our workspace anymore, we import the data and convert it to a `ppp` object again.

```{r, message = FALSE}
  setwd('C:/Users/Maximilian/ownCloud/03_Lehre/Spatial_Statistics/Practicals/Spatial_statistics_R')
  douglas_fir <- read_delim(file = 'DouglasFir_LiveDead_OGN.txt', delim = ';')
  
  douglas_fir <- mutate(douglas_fir,
                        mark = case_when(mark == 1 ~ 'alive',
                                         mark == 2 ~ 'dead'),
                        mark = as.factor(mark))
  
  plot_area <- ripras(x = douglas_fir$x, y = douglas_fir$y, shape = 'rectangle')
  douglas_fir_ppp <- as.ppp(X = douglas_fir, W = plot_area)
```

The same goes for the O-ring statistic.

```{r}
  Oest <- function(input, correction = 'Ripley', r = NULL, ...){
    p_fct <- pcf(input, correction = correction, r = r, divisor = 'd')
    lambda <- intensity(unmark(input))
    eval.fv(p_fct*lambda)
  }
```

The function `envelope()` can also be used to simulate more complex null models than _CSR_ and basically all functions (`fun`) that return a `fv` object. This time, we use the bivariate pair-correlation function as `fun` called `pcfcross` in `spatstat`. We need to specify the arguments of `pcfcross` `i` and `j` indicating the two types of marks. `simulate` allows us to specify any possible null model as an expression. Random labeling can be simulated with the help of `rlabel`. Lastly, we specify the number of simulation (`nsim`) and the highest/lowest values to use for the envelopes (`nrank`) and the distances at which the function should be evaluated (`r`) just as before.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
  simulaion_envelope_random_labeling <- envelope(douglas_fir_ppp, fun = pcfcross, i = 'alive', j = 'dead', 
                                                 r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, by = 0.5),
                                                 divisor = 'd', nsim = 199, nrank = 5,
                                                 simulate = expression(rlabel(douglas_fir_ppp)))
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,  fig.align = 'center'}
  plot(simulaion_envelope_random_labeling, xlim = c(0,45), 
       main = 'Bivariate pair correlation function\nrandom labelling', legend = FALSE)
```

## Exercise 6
__Task:__ Can the small-scale regularity in the live Douglas fir trees be modeled by a hard-core process? What about a soft-core process?

We can use `rStrauss()` to simulate hardcore- and softcore processes. Firstly, we subset the data using only living trees. Then, we simulate the hardcore process. We want the same intensity as the observed data (`beta`). `R` is the interaction distance between the points and `gamma` is the probability of two points being separated by distances < `R`. Therefore, setting this argument to 0 leads to a hardcore process. Lastly, we need to specify the number of (`nsim`) and the observation window (`W`, same as observed data) of the simulated patterns.

```{r}
  alive <- subset.ppp(douglas_fir_ppp, marks == 'alive', drop = T)
  
  simulated_patterns_hardcore <-rStrauss(beta = intensity(alive),
                                         R = 1, gamma = 0, 
                                         nsim = 199, W = alive$window)
```

The result is a list of simulated point patterns, that can be used as the `simulate` argument of the `envelope()` function. Now, the function calculates the summary function for each pattern in the list and computes the envelopes based on the results.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
  envelope_hardcore <- envelope(Y = alive, fun = Oest, 
                                r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, by = 0.5),
                                nsim = 199, nrank = 5,
                                simulate = simulated_patterns_hardcore)
```

The softcore process is very similar, with the only difference that the probability `gamma` of two points being separated by distance `R` is increased.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results = 'hide'}
  simulated_patterns_softcore <- rStrauss(beta = intensity(alive),
                                          R = 1, gamma = 0.3, 
                                          nsim = 199, W = alive$window)

  envelope_softcore <- envelope(alive, fun = Oest,
                                r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, by = 0.5),
                                nsim = 199, nrank = 5,
                                simulate = simulated_patterns_softcore)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,  fig.align = 'center'}
  # par(mfrow=c(1,2))
  plot(envelope_hardcore, xlim=c(0,45), 
       main = "Univariate O-ring statistic\nhard-core process", legend = FALSE)
      
  plot(envelope_softcore,xlim=c(0,45), 
       main = "Univariate O-ring statistic\nsoft-core process", legend = FALSE)
  # par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

## Exercise 7 
__Task:__ Now use the data set 'DouglasFir_Adult_vs_Seedling_OG-N.txt'. Here, pattern 1 gives the locations of adult trees and pattern 2 gives the locations of seedlings. Calculate O12(r) and generate 95% confidence envelopes for the null model 'Pattern 1 fixed, pattern 2 random' (antecedent conditions). What would be a meaningful interpretation of the results?

Firstly, we import the data and convert it to a `ppp` object. Also, we reclassify the mark column to 1 == 'adults' and 2 == 'seedlings' and convert is as a factor. 

```{r}
  setwd('C:/Users/Maximilian/ownCloud/03_Lehre/Spatial_Statistics/Practicals/Spatial_statistics_R')
  douglas_fir <- read_delim(file = 'DouglasFir_Adult_vs_Seedling_OG-N.txt', delim = ';')
  
  douglas_fir <- mutate(douglas_fir,
                        mark = case_when(mark == 1 ~ 'adults',
                                         mark == 2 ~ 'seedlings'),
                        mark = as.factor(mark))
  
  plot_area <- ripras(x = douglas_fir$x, y = douglas_fir$y, shape = 'rectangle')
  douglas_fir_ppp <- as.ppp(X = douglas_fir, W = plot_area)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
  plot(douglas_fir_ppp, main = "Douglas fir")
```

Now, we need to implement the bivariate O-ring statistic O12(r). We want to multiply the bivariate pair-correlation function g12(r) with the intensity of lambda2.

```{r}
Oestcross <- function(input,i,j, correction = 'Ripley', r = NULL, ......){
  gij <- pcfcross(input, 
                  i = i, j = j, r = r,
                  correction = correction, divisor = "d")
  lambda <- intensity(input)[j]
  eval.fv(gij * lambda)
}
```

`spatstat` has no build-in function to simulate a null model of _antecedent conditions_. But remember, we can give the `simulate` argument of the `envelope()` function a list of patterns. Therefore, we just need to simulate the null model and save the results in a list. 

After splitting the point pattern into seedlings and adults, we create a new, random pattern with the same number of points (`n`) and the same observation window (`win`) as the seedlings. Then, we superimpose the random seedlings with the unchanged adults. Lastly, we save the result in a list.

```{r}
null_model_pattern <- list()

for(i in 1:199){
  seedlings <- subset.ppp(douglas_fir_ppp, marks == "seedlings", drop = TRUE)
  adults <- subset(douglas_fir_ppp, marks == "adults", drop = TRUE)
  
  random_seedlings <- rpoint(n = seedlings$n,
                             win = seedlings$window)
  
  overall_pattern <-  superimpose(adults = unmark(adults),
                                  seedlings = random_seedlings)
  
  null_model_pattern[i] <- list(overall_pattern )
}
```
Now, we can compute the simulation envelopes as usually.

```{r,  message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
  antecedent_conditions <- envelope(douglas_fir_ppp, fun = Oestcross, 
                                    i = "adults", j = "seedlings",
                                    r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, by = 0.5),
                                    nsim = 199,  nrank = 5,
                                    simulate = null_model_pattern)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
  plot(antecedent_conditions, xlim = c(0, 45),
       main = "Bivariate O-ring statistic\nantecedent conditions", legend = FALSE)
```

## Exercise 8
__Task:__ How does the interpretation of the 'Toroidal shift' null model differ from the null models in 7)? What is the advantage? Is it always an advantage?

There is a possibility to simulate the toroidal shift null model with functions provided by `spatstat`. We just use the function `rshift()` and specify the behavior at the edge of the observation area (`edge`) and which points should be shifted (`which`).

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
  trdl.shft <- envelope(douglas_fir_ppp, fun = Oestcross, 
                        i = "adults", j = "seedlings",
                        r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, by = 0.5),
                        nsim = 199, nrank = 5,
                        simulate = expression(rshift(douglas_fir_ppp, which = "seedlings", edge="torus")))
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
  plot(trdl.shft, xlim = c(0, 45), 
       main = "Bivariate O-ring statistic\ntoroidal shift",  legend = FALSE)
```
