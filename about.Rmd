Here you can find all practicals for the Spatial statistics course. The practicals will be availaible bit by bit once the topics were covered in the lectures.

You can choose if you prefer the results using [Programita](http://programita.org) or [R](https://www.r-project.org). Anyways, for the following plenum discussions, I suggest taking screenshots of the results for each exercise.

In case you have any questions or trouble, please write me an e-mail or come to my office at any time. You can find my contact information under "More..." on this homepage.

All data can be found here:
