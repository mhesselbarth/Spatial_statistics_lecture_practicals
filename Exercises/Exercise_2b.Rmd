# ... continiued Homogenous null model 

#### Exercise 5)
Calculate the bivariate $g_{12}(r)$ function using the null model random labeling. Was the process that labeled trees as dead or alive a random process?

For more information, see Slide 77 & 83 ff.

#### Exercise 6) 
Can the small-scale regularity in the live Douglas fir trees be modeled by a hard-core process? What about a soft-core process?

For more information, see Slides 68 ff.

#### Exercise 7) 
Now use the data set _DouglasFir_Adult_vs_Seedling_OGN.dat_. Here, pattern 1 gives the locations of adult trees and pattern 2 gives the locations of seedlings. Calculate $O_{12}(r)$ and generate 95% confidence envelopes for the null model 'Pattern 1 fixed, pattern 2 random' (antecedent conditions). What would be a meaningful interpretation of the results?

#### Exercise 8) 
How does the interpretation of the 'Toroidal shift' null model differ from the null models in 7)? What is the advantage? Is it always an advantage?
