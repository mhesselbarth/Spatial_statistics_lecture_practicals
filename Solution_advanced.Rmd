# Cluster process

### Exercise 1 
**Task:** Perform a point-pattern analysis on the *Hemlock_Adults_vs_SmallSaps* data set using 'CSR' as null model. We are now especially interested in pattern 2, the small saplings. Using a cell size of 1 meter, calculate the O22(r). Up to which scale do we find significant clustering of the saplings?

We import the data first and convert it as `ppp`. Also, we reclassify the marks as 1 == 'adults' and 2 == 'saplings'.

```{r solution_adv_import_data_a, message = FALSE, collapse = TRUE}
  hemlock <- read_delim(file = "Data/Hemlock_Adults_vs_SmallSaps.txt", 
                        delim = ";")
  
  hemlock <- mutate(hemlock,
                    mark = case_when(mark == 1 ~ "adults",
                                     mark == 2 ~ "saplings"),
                    mark = as.factor(mark))
  
  plot_area <- ripras(x = hemlock$x, y = hemlock$y, shape = "rectangle")
  
  hemlock_ppp <- as.ppp(X = hemlock, W = plot_area)
  
  summary(hemlock_ppp)
```

```{r solution_adv_plot_data, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(hemlock_ppp, main = "Hemlock")
```

Then, we implement the O-ring statistic.

```{r solution_adv_define_fun}
  Oest <- function(input, r = NULL, 
                   correction = "Ripley", divisor = "d", ...){
    
    p_fct <- pcf(input, r = r,
                 correction = correction, 
                 divisor = divisor)
    
    lambda <- intensity(unmark(input))
    
    eval.fv(p_fct*lambda)
  }
```

We are just interested in the saplings, therefore we subset them first. Then we calculate the O-ring statistic with simulation envelopes and 'CSR' as null model.

```{r solution_adv_subset_data, results = "hide"}
  saplings <- subset.ppp(hemlock_ppp, marks == "saplings", drop = TRUE)
  
  o_ring_saplings <- envelope(saplings, fun = Oest,
                              r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, by = 0.5), 
                              nsim = 199, nrank = 5)
```

```{r solution_adv_plot_subset, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(o_ring_saplings, xlim = c(0, 45), 
       main = "O-ring statistic\nsaplings", 
       legend = FALSE)
```

### Exercise 2 
**Task:** Use the pair-correlation function to fit a cluster process to the data and use the fitted model to simulate null model data

We use the function `kkpm()` to fit a cluster point process model. We need to provide the point pattern (`X`, here we need to remove all marks with `unmark()` because `subset.ppp()` only drops all unused levels, but does not remove all marks). We specify the cluster type we want to fit (`cluster`) and which summary function to use (`pcf`). Then, we simulate patterns using the fitted process with `simulate.kppm()`. We need to provide the model (`object`) and the number of simulations (`nsim`). The result is a list of simulated patterns.

```{r solution_adv_thomas, results = "hide", warning = FALSE}
  thomas_process <- kppm(X = unmark(saplings), clusters = "Thomas", 
                         statistic = "pcf")
  
  simulated_pattern	<- simulate.kppm(object = thomas_process, nsim = 199)
```

Now, we can compute the envelopes of the null model and compare it to the observed data.

```{r solution_adv_envelopes_thomas, results = "hide"}  
  o22_saplings_thomas <- envelope(saplings, fun = Oest, 
                                  r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, by = 0.5),
                                  nsim = 199, nrank = 5, 
                                  simulate = simulated_pattern)
```

```{r solution_adv_plot_thomas, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(o22_saplings_thomas, xlim = c(0, 45), 
       main = "Hemlock saplings\nThomas process", legend = FALSE)
```

### Exercise 3
**Task:** If the $O_{11}(r)$ function falls into the new envelope, you fitted good parameters for the cluster process. Have a look at the fitted parameters. Here, the typical cluster size and number of parents are  of interest.

`kappa` is the intensity of cluster centers. In order to get the 'number of parents', we need to multiply the number with the area of the observation window (remember: the intensity is the number per unit area). Luckily, `spatstat` contains a function (`area()`) to calculate the area. The `scale` parameter gives the standard deviation of random displacement of a point from its cluster center. To calculate the area of a cluster, we need to calculate the area of the according 'circle'. The `Mean cluster size` gives exactly what it says.

```{r solution_adv_model_parameter, collapse = TRUE}
  print(thomas_process)
```
  
```{r solution_adv_no_parents, echo = FALSE, collapse = TRUE}
  # Check with Programita!
  paste0("Number of parents: ", 
         round(thomas_process$clustpar[["kappa"]] * spatstat.geom::area(saplings$window), 2))

  paste0("Cluster area: ", 
         round((thomas_process$clustpar[["scale"]] ^ 2) * pi, 2))
```

# Mark correlation function (Stoyan's $k_{mm}$)

### Exercise 1 
**Task:** The data set *Alive_DouglasFir_OGN* contains the location and stem diameters (diameter at breast height, DBH) for all live Douglas fir trees in the Old-growth North plot. Calculate the mark-correlation function for the DBH. What do these results suggest?

First, we need to import the data, convert them as `ppp` object and have a look at the data. This time, the marks are continuous, i.e. the diameter at breast height in cm of each tree. Therefore, the `summary()` function automatically gives the mean, median and quantiles of the data. Also, the plot automatically scales the point according to their size. 

```{r solution_adv_import_data_b, message = FALSE, collapse = TRUE}
  douglas_fir <- read_delim(file = "Data/Alive_DouglasFir_OGN.txt", 
                            delim = ";")
  
  plot_area <- ripras(x = douglas_fir$x, y = douglas_fir$y, 
                      shape = "rectangle")
  
  douglas_fir_ppp <- as.ppp(X = douglas_fir, W = plot_area)
  
  summary(douglas_fir_ppp)
```

```{r solution_adv_plot_snd_data, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(douglas_fir_ppp, main = "Douglas fir")
```

The mark-correlation function can be calculated with `markcorr()`. This is very straightforward.

```{r solution_adv_mark_correlation}
  mark_corrlation_douglas_fir <- markcorr(X = douglas_fir_ppp, 
                                          r = seq(from = 0, to = 45,
                                                  by = 0.5),
                                          correction = "Ripley")
```

```{r solution_adv_plot_mark_correlation, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(mark_corrlation_douglas_fir, xlim = c(0, 45), 
       main = "Mark correlation function\nDouglas fir", 
       legend = FALSE)
```

### Exercise 2 
**Task:** Calculate simulation envelopes to test for significance. As a null model use random labelling. What could be a possible ecological explanation of your results?

We use `envelope()` to calculate the simulation envelopes. As null model, we use random labeling, shuffling only the marks but not the points (`simulate` argument using `rlabel()`).

```{r solution_adv_envelopes_mark_correlation, results = "hide"}
  envelopes_mark_correlation_alive <- envelope(Y = douglas_fir_ppp, 
                                               fun = markcorr,
                                               r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, 
                                                       by = 0.5),
                                               nsim = 199, nrank = 5,
                                               simulate = expression(rlabel(douglas_fir_ppp)))
```

```{r solution_adv_plot_envelopes_mark_correlation, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(envelopes_mark_correlation_alive, xlim = c(0, 45), 
       main = "Mark correlation function\nDouglas fir", 
       legend = FALSE)
```

# Inhomogeneous point patterns 

### Exercise 1 
**Task:** In the data set *Hemlock_Adults_vs_SmallSaps*, you can observe a clear gradient in the density of adult trees. Calculate O11(r) and L11(r) for pattern 1 (adult trees) to see up to which scale clustering of the trees can be observed using 'CSR' as null model.

We import the data, classify it and convert it as `ppp` object. We plot the point pattern of only adult trees and have a look at the summary.

```{r solution_adv_import_trd_data, message = FALSE, collapse = TRUE}
  hemlock <- read_delim(file = "Data/Hemlock_Adults_vs_SmallSaps.txt", 
                        delim = ";")
  
  hemlock <- mutate(hemlock,
                    mark = case_when(mark == 1 ~ "adults",
                                     mark == 2 ~ "saplings"),
                    mark = as.factor(mark))
  
  plot_area <- ripras(x = hemlock$x, y = hemlock$y, 
                      shape = "rectangle")
  
  hemlock_ppp <- as.ppp(X = hemlock, W = plot_area)
  
  summary(hemlock_ppp)
```

```{r solution_adv_plot_trd_data , echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(subset.ppp(hemlock_ppp, marks == "adults", drop = TRUE), 
       main = "Hemlock \nadults")
```

Also, we need to implement the O-ring statistic as before.

```{r solution_adv_define_fun_new}
  Oest <- function(input,r = NULL,
                   correction = "Ripley", divisor = "d", ...){
    
    p_fct <- pcf(input,  r = r,
                 correction = correction, divisor = divisor, ...)
    
    lambda <- intensity(unmark(input))
    
    eval.fv(p_fct*lambda)
  }
``` 

We calculate the O-ring statistic for the adult trees only, using `envelope()` and the null model of 'CSR'. 

```{r solution_adv_oring_adults, results = "hide"}
  adults <- subset.ppp(hemlock_ppp, marks == "adults", drop = TRUE)
  
  envelopes_adults_homo <- envelope(Y = adults, fun = Oest,
                                    r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, by = 0.5), 
                                    nsim = 199, rank = 5)
```

```{r solution_adv_plot_oring_adults, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(envelopes_adults_homo, xlim = c(0,45), 
       main = "Homogenous Poisson process")
```

### Exercise 2 
**Task:** Getzin et al. (2008) show that the study area is heterogenous. We are going to account for this heterogeneity by fitting a heterogeneous Poisson processes. Estimate $\lambda(x,y)$ and plot a map of the results. The gradient should be well visible.

Firstly, we need to get the intensity $\lambda(xy)$ at every point of the observation window. The result is a `im` (pixel image) object. 

```{r solution_adv_lambda, collapse = TRUE}
  lambda_xy <- density(x = adults)

  class(lambda_xy)
```

```{r solution_adv_plot_lambda, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(lambda_xy, main = "lambda(xy)")
```

### Exercise 3
**Task:** Use the previously estimated intensity $\lambda(x,y)$ to simulate a heterogenous Poisson process. Does $O_{11}(r)$ now fit into the simulation envelope? How do you interpret the result?

Now, we can simulate heterogeneous point patterns following the intensity of the pattern. Therefore, we use `rpoispp()` and specify the argument `lambda` with the created `im` object. Also, we specify the number of simulated patterns (`nsim`). The result is a list with heterogeneous point patterns. If you plot one realization of the simulated data, you can see how the random points 'follow' the intensity.

```{r solution_adv_simul_hetero}
  simulated_heterogenous_pattern <- rpoispp(lambda = lambda_xy, nsim = 199)
```

```{r solution_adv_plot_hetero, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(lambda_xy, main = "Simulated data")

  points(simulated_heterogenous_pattern[[5]], pch = 19)
``` 

Now, we can use the simulated point patterns as input for `envelope()` to create simulation envelopes with the null model of a heterogeneous Poisson process.

```{r solution_adv_envelopes_hetero, results = "hide"}
  envelopes_adults_hetero <- envelope(Y = adults, fun = Oest,
                                      r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, 
                                              by = 0.5), 
                                      nsim = 199, rank = 5, 
                                      simulate = simulated_heterogenous_pattern)

```

```{r solution_adv_plot_sim_hetero, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(envelopes_adults_hetero, xlim = c(0, 45), 
       main = "Heterogenous Poisson process")
```

There is a wrapper around these function in [`onpoint`](https://r-spatialecology.github.io/onpoint/) to simulate a heterogeneous Poisson process as null model (see `?simulate_heterogenous_pattern`).

#### Using the inhomogenous pair-correlation function

Instead of using `lambda` to simulate a heterogeneous Poisson process, `spatstat` can also can calculate the inhomogenous pair-correlation function. This functions uses a kernel methods during the computation of $g_{inhom}(r)$ whick takes the heterogeneity of the point pattern into account. Thus, we can use CSR as null model.

```{r solution_adv_envelopes_inhomo, results = "hide"}
  envelopes_adults_inhomo <- envelope(Y = adults, fun = pcfinhom, 
                                      divisor = "d",
                                      correction = "Ripley",
                                      r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, by = 0.5),
                                      nsim = 199, rank = 5)
```

```{r solution_adv_plot_envelopes_hetero, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
  plot(envelopes_adults_inhomo, xlim = c(0,45),
       main = "Inhomogenous pair correlation function",
       legend = FALSE)
```

# Softcore- and Hardcore Process
### Exercise 1
**Task:** Can the small-scale regularity in the living Douglas fir trees be modeled by a hard-core process? What about a soft-core process?
 
First, we need to import the data and convert it to a `ppp` object. 

```{r solution_adv_import_data_c, message = FALSE}
  douglas_fir <- read_delim(file = "Data/DouglasFir_LiveDead_OGN.txt", 
                            delim = ";")
  
  douglas_fir <- mutate(douglas_fir,
                        mark = case_when(mark == 1 ~ "alive",
                                         mark == 2 ~ "dead"),
                        mark = as.factor(mark))
  
  plot_area <- ripras(x = douglas_fir$x, y = douglas_fir$y, 
                      shape = "rectangle")
  
  douglas_fir_ppp <- as.ppp(X = douglas_fir, W = plot_area)
```
  
We can use `rStrauss()` to simulate hardcore- and softcore processes. Firstly, we subset the data using only living trees. Then, we simulate the hardcore process. We want the same intensity as the observed data (`beta`). `R` is the interaction distance between the points and `gamma` is the probability of two points being separated by distances < `R`. Therefore, setting this argument to 0 leads to a hardcore process. Lastly, we need to specify the number of (`nsim`) and the observation window (`W`, same as observed data) of the simulated patterns.

```{r s_2b_sim_hardcore}
alive <- subset.ppp(douglas_fir_ppp, marks == "alive", drop = T)

simulated_patterns_hardcore <- rStrauss(beta = intensity(alive),
                                        R = 1, gamma = 0, 
                                        nsim = 199, W = alive$window)
```

The result is a list of simulated point patterns, that can be used as the `simulate` argument of the `envelope()` function. Now, the function calculates the summary function for each pattern in the list and computes the envelopes based on the results.

```{r s_2b_envelopes_hardcore, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide"}
envelope_hardcore <- envelope(Y = alive, fun = Oest, 
                              r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, by = 0.5),
                              nsim = 199, nrank = 5,
                              simulate = simulated_patterns_hardcore)
```

The softcore process is very similar, with the only difference that the probability `gamma` of two points being separated by distance `R` is increased.

```{r s_2b_softcore, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, results = "hide"}
simulated_patterns_softcore <- rStrauss(beta = intensity(alive),
                                        R = 1, gamma = 0.3, 
                                        nsim = 199, W = alive$window)

envelope_softcore <- envelope(alive, fun = Oest,
                              r = seq(from = 0, to = 45, by = 0.5),
                              nsim = 199, nrank = 5,
                              simulate = simulated_patterns_softcore)
```

```{r s_2b_plot_hardcore, echo = FALSE,  fig.align = "center"}
# par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(envelope_hardcore, xlim = c(0,45), 
     main = "Univariate O-ring statistic\nhard-core process",
     legend = FALSE)

plot(envelope_softcore,xlim = c(0,45), 
     main = "Univariate O-ring statistic\nsoft-core process", 
     legend = FALSE)
# par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```
